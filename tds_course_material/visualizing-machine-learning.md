You'll learn about improving customer retention, understanding black box models, and using clustering for market segmentation:

- **Churn Reduction**: Use decision trees to identify customers likely to leave.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Compare customer acquisition vs. retention costs.
- **Model Improvement**: Apply SVMs and neural networks for better accuracy.
- **Project Challenges**: Understand issues with black box models in implementation.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segment markets using demographic data.
- **Data Visualization**: Interpret clustering results using maps and charts.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between currency exchange rates.
- **Tool Proficiency**: Utilize Excel, Python, and JavaScript for analysis and communication.
- **Practical Application**: Tailor marketing strategies based on cluster characteristics.
