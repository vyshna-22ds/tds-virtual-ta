**Q1: What are the essential base technologies to learn for the TDS course?**

**A1:** Focus on these three areas: 1) Bash and shell scripting; 2) Git; 3) CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Also, learn REST APIs. Other tools can be learned on the go once you have a basic understanding of these core technologies.

**Q2: Regarding the tools and techniques needed for the TDS course, are Bash and shell scripting, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs the only essential ones?**

**A2:** Yes, those are the core technologies. Other tools are supplementary and can be learned as needed throughout the course. The instructor suggests a three-part approach to learning: 1) Define the purpose; 2) Determine the technique; 3) Select the tools.

**Q3: In short, is it sufficient to learn the listed technologies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma?**

**A3:** Yes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task.

**Q4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?**

**A4:** For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab.

**Q5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why?**

**A5:** A 404 error means the page isn't found. The instructor suggests posting a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum for more detailed debugging.

**Q6: In the Llama file question, the URL shows the correct answer initially, but after refreshing, it shows an incorrect answer. Why?**

**A6:** Post a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum. This will allow the instructor to check the backend and the script to determine the cause.

**Q7: Are the graded assignments open internet or closed internet?**

**A7:** All graded assignments are open internet, except for the final in-person exam, which is closed internet.

**Q8: I'm having trouble signing into GitHub with my IIT email. Is GitHub only available for personal emails?**

**A8:** GitHub is available for any email. You need to sign up first, then sign in. For evaluation purposes, your submissions will be linked to the email address you use to log in. The instructor recommends signing up with your IIT email.

**Q9: For the GitHub question, if I've signed in with a personal ID but also have an IIT ID, will that be a problem?**

**A9:** There shouldn't be a problem. The instructor recommends using your IIT email for evaluation purposes.

**Q10: In the graded assignment 2, image compression, I'm getting an error: "Could not process the image. Is it browser supported? Image pixels do not match the original." I've tried several ways, including using Photoshop to ensure the image resolution is the same. What's wrong?**

**A10:** The image size should be less than 1,300,000 bytes. The instructor will make a note of this issue and investigate. The error may be browser-related, so trying a different browser might help. The instructor also requests the Discourse link be shared.

**Q11: For the TDS project, do we have to choose the project, or will it be added to our course by default?**

**A11:** The TDS project is part of the course and will be automatically added. It's not a separate project like in other courses.

**Q12: Should I be worried that the evaluation scripts might be updated after I submit my answers, potentially changing my grade?**

**A12:** No, the evaluation scripts are updated to address additional corner cases, but the randomization of questions means that the changes are unlikely to affect your grade. The instructor suggests checking your answers again using GA2 as an exercise.

**Q13: How will we submit Project 1? Will it be via Google Form?**

**A13:** Yes, Project 1 will be submitted via Google Form. The deliverable will be a GitHub repository.

**Q14: I'm using Windows, but many questions require Ubuntu. I copied the downloaded files to my WSL home folder, but I'm not getting the correct answers. Is it possible to install a Windows system in Linux?**

**A14:** You can use WSL. The instructor asks for a screenshot to debug the issue. The student explains that they copied the files (a.txt and b.txt) to a TDS folder in their Ubuntu WSL environment. The `diff` command shows 40 lines of difference, but the submission is not accepted. The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum.

**Q15: Question 16 in GA1 (rename files) is not accepting my answer, even though I've tried using ChatGPT. What's wrong?**

**A15:** The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum with your email ID. The instructor notes that many submissions are randomized, so the issue may be related to the specific randomized version of the question.
