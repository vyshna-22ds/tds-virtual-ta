**Q1: Where can I find the uploaded documents?**

**A1:** The uploaded documents are added as part of a YouTube playlist. You should be able to see them on YouTube.

**Q2: How should I approach TDS?**

**A2:** The best way to learn TDS is through practice. The course is designed to handle day-to-day data science problems. It introduces everyday development tools (from VS Code to npm) and provides hands-on experience solving problems. The graded assignments (GAs) are practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Focus on working through the examples and familiarizing yourself with the tools.

**Q3: I'm new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do?**

**A3:** GA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools. The course content is available on the course introduction page, not just in the GA modules.

**Q4: The YouTube videos are not clear enough. Can we have personalized videos?**

**A4:** The TAs will hold dedicated sessions to address this learning curve. These sessions will cover the tools in detail and will be recorded and uploaded.

**Q5: I'm not from a science background and find the course difficult. What can I do?**

**A5:** The course is not an intro to programming. Focus on the practical exercises and use the TAs' sessions to get help. The instructors will consider adding more introductory sessions to address the skill gap.

**Q6: I took TDS two terms ago and haven't gained any extra skills. I only want to complete this course and leave. What should I do?**

**A6:** The course has changed significantly since two terms ago. The instructors will consider adding more support sessions to help students catch up.

**Q7: The deadline for GA1 is the 26th, and help was only provided after the deadline last term. Will this happen again?**

**A7:** The TAs will hold sessions _before_ the GA deadline to help you learn how to use the tools.

**Q8: The graded assignments (GAs) are practical, but the end-of-term exam is theory-based. Where can I learn the theory?**

**A8:** The end-of-term exam format is changing. The instructors will provide a mock exam before the actual exam. Focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools.

**Q9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?**

**A9:** Your answers are likely saved. If you added a question, re-enter all answers and save again. The instructors are working on a backend fix to prevent this.

**Q10: What is the R0E and what should I focus on for grading?**

**A10:** The projects are take-home, open-internet assignments. You'll receive a dataset and questions. R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions.

**Q11: I'm a non-IT student (Masters in Mathematics). Can I get an IT job with just the Data Science diploma?**

**A11:** It's possible, but it depends on the company's requirements. Programming skills are valuable in many fields.

**Q12: Should I take the programming diploma along with the data science diploma?**

**A12:** Programming skills are very valuable. The two diplomas complement each other.

**Q13: What are some standard tools I should focus on?**

**A13:** Bash has been around since the 1970s. Focus on newer tools and techniques, such as LLMs and GPTs, which are powerful and in high demand.

**Q14: What if I want to learn the tools more deeply?**

**A14:** Learn by using the tools frequently in your workflows. The instructors will provide more support sessions.

**Q15: Can we have sessions on installing the Linux system?**

**A15:** The instructors will discuss this with the TAs and schedule sessions if needed. Note that you may not need to install a full Linux system; Google Colab provides a Linux environment.

**Q16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?**

**A16:** Yes, they will be added to a playlist on the Google Calendar. Bookmark the TDS channel to easily find the playlist. The videos themselves will be on YouTube.

**Q17: Can you request the programming faculty to add content similar to TDS to the programming diploma?**

**A17:** Post this request on Discourse and tag the relevant people.

**Q18: What is a "take-home open internet" project?**

**A18:** You'll receive a dataset and questions. You can use any resources to answer the questions.

**Q19: What weeks are relevant to each project?**

**A19:** Project 1 will cover the first four or five modules. Project 2 will cover a wider range of topics.

**Q20: I have a basic understanding of the tools, but not a great one. Should I continue or drop the course?**

**A20:** If you can solve the problems, that's good enough. The course is meant to introduce you to the tools, not make you an expert. Focus on the new tools and techniques. You can always get certifications for other skills later.
