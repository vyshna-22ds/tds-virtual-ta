You'll learn how to perform geospatial analysis for location-based decision making, covering:

- **Distance Calculation**: Compute distances between various store locations and a reference point, such as the Empire State Building.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize store locations on a map using Python libraries like Folium.
- **Store Density Analysis**: Determine the number of stores within a specified radius.
- **Proximity Analysis**: Identify the closest and farthest stores from a specific location.
- **Decision Making**: Use geospatial data to assess whether opening a new store is feasible based on existing store distribution.
